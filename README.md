# RAG-Based Attention YOLO App

This repository contains an implementation of a state-of-the-art **Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG)** application leveraging **Transformer-based Attention mechanisms** and **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) for object detection and analysis. The project demonstrates the fusion of generative AI models with real-time object detection to create a versatile tool for various use cases such as content generation, image analysis, and decision support systems.

## Overview
This project combines:
- **RAG**: Implements retrieval-augmented generation using Transformers (based on "Attention is All You Need") for generating contextual responses.
- **YOLO**: Real-time object detection, providing efficient bounding box predictions and class probabilities.

### Key Papers
1. [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al.
2. [You Only Look Once](https://pjreddie.com/yolo/) by Redmon et al.

## Features
- Retrieval-Augmented text generation with Transformer-based models.
- Real-time object detection using YOLO.
- Efficient combination of object detection results with AI-generated content.
- Fully functional Jupyter notebook (`rag-app.ipynb`) demonstrating the implementation.

---

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NVIDIA GPU (optional but recommended for YOLO processing)
  
---

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-app
   cd rag-app

---

### Usage

## Running the Application
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook rag-app.ipynb
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
- Preprocess data.
- Use the YOLO model for object detection.
- Apply the RAG model for content generation based on detected objects.

---

### Project Architecture

## YOLO Component:
- Divides input images into an S Ã— S grid.
- Detects bounding boxes and classifies objects in real-time.
## RAG Component:
- Uses attention mechanisms to generate contextual text responses based on retrieved knowledge.

---

### Dataset

The project uses pre-trained YOLO weights and knowledge datasets for RAG. Users can adapt the project to specific domains by fine-tuning on custom datasets.
